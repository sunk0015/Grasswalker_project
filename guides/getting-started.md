# Graswalker Quick-Start
This is a brief "how-to" guide targeted for Lab admins (lab owners) to use Grasswalker's functionality.

## High Level Overview
* Grasswalker at its core is an academic data sharing resource that allows independent labs to 
    1. Organize and structure lab research data.  
    2. Potentially share their data with other labs in the Grasswalker network.
* Labs are the highest level of organization in the Grasswalker network. Each Lab contains:
    1. Lab admin, who is the owner lab and has access to the admin console and the main user interace. Has some elevated priviliges discussed in detail in the admin guide.
    2. Users, who are members of their owning lab. They have access to Grasswalker through the main user interface.
    3. Folders, which are the base units of organizations. Folders may be nested in other folders. Top level folders are referred to as Projects.
    4. Datasets, which contain the actual data to be stored. Datasets must be in a folder.
    5. Templates, which can be created and linked to datasets to ensure that the dataset is appropriately annotated.
